## Documentation Architecture

### Multi-Audience Approach
The documentation is strategically organized by user type:

**Connie End Users** (Nonprofit staff):
- `end-users/cbo-admins/` - Organization administrators
- `end-users/supervisors/` - Team managers
- `end-users/staff-agents/` - Call center agents

**Connie Developers** (Contributors):
- `developers/general/` - Cross-cutting development topics
- `developers/frontend/` - React/TypeScript development
- `developers/backend/` - Serverless functions development

### Design Principles
1. **Clear user paths** - Immediate audience selection on landing page
2. **Professional branding** - "Connie" prefix in all navigation
3. **Future-proof structure** - Easy to add new audiences/content
4. **Accessibility compliance** - WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Key Workflows

### Documentation Updates
```bash
# 1. Test locally FIRST
cd docs
npm install  # (first time only)
npm start    # http://localhost:3010

# 2. Make changes and verify in browser
# 3. Commit and deploy
git add docs/
git commit -m "Update documentation: describe changes"
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys via GitHub Pages
```

### CRITICAL: Docusaurus Linking Rules
**Always use absolute paths for internal links to avoid broken link deployment failures:**

```markdown
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use absolute paths
[Setup Guide](/end-users/cbo-admins/getting-started)
[API Docs](/developers/backend/api-reference)

# ‚ùå WRONG - Relative paths cause deployment failures
[Setup Guide](../getting-started)
[API Docs](./api-reference)
[Setup Guide](getting-started)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Docusaurus resolves relative paths differently during build vs dev
- Broken links cause GitHub Pages deployment to fail completely
- Always test locally with `npm run build` before pushing
- Use absolute paths starting with `/` for all internal documentation links

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start full development environment
npm start  # Runs serverless + plugin + insights proxy

# Individual components
npm run start:serverless  # Port 3001
npm run start:plugin     # Port 3000
npm run start:insights   # Insights proxy
```

## Important Context for AI Agents

### Audience Sensitivity
- **CBO Admins** often have limited technical background
- **Staff Agents** need quick, actionable information during calls
- **Supervisors** focus on team management and reporting
- **Developers** range from beginners to experts

### Writing Guidelines
- **Plain language** - Avoid technical jargon for end users
- **Action-oriented** - Tell users what to do, not just what things are
- **Accessible** - Consider screen readers, low vision, cognitive differences
- **Inclusive** - Use person-first language, avoid assumptions

### Critical Considerations
- **Never assume database expertise** - Many nonprofits use Google Sheets
- **Resource constraints** - Solutions must work with limited budgets
- **Privacy-first** - Data stays in customer systems
- **Graceful degradation** - Systems must work even with limited setup

## Technology Stack Context

### Frontend (Flex Plugin)
- **React + TypeScript** - Type-safe component development
- **Twilio Paste** - Design system for consistency
- **Flex Hooks** - Integration with Twilio Flex platform

### Backend (Serverless Functions)
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Twilio Serverless** - Managed serverless platform
- **Multi-database support** - Google Sheets, MySQL, PostgreSQL, APIs

### Documentation (Docusaurus)
- **React-based** - Allows custom interactive components
- **Multiple sidebars** - Different navigation for different audiences
- **MDX support** - Markdown with React components

## Common Patterns & Standards

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for files: `getting-started.md`
- Descriptive names: `cbo-admin-setup.md` not `setup.md`
- Consistent numbering: `00_introduction.md`, `01_setup.md`

### Content Structure
```markdown
---
sidebar_label: Short Name
sidebar_position: 1
title: "Full Descriptive Title"
---

- **Professional Services**: [Enterprise support]

## Decision History

### Multi-Audience Documentation (2024)
**Decision**: Split documentation by user type instead of technical area
**Rationale**: 
- CBO admins have different needs than developers
- Reduces cognitive load by showing relevant content only
- Scales better as platform grows
- Improves user experience significantly

**Implementation**: 
- Landing page with audience selection
- Separate directory structure for each audience  
- Multiple sidebar configurations
- Consistent "Connie" branding throughout

### Channel-Based Documentation Structure (2024)
**Decision**: Organize docs by CPaaS communication channels (Voice, Messaging, Socials, Fax, Email)
**Rationale**:
- Startup needs practical organization that can grow organically
- Channel-based structure matches how CPaaS services are naturally categorized
- Allows for both end-user and developer perspectives within each channel
- Provides clear path for adding new docs as services expand

**Implementation**:
- Created `voice/` category under `end-users/cbo-admins/`
- Used Docusaurus `autogenerated` sidebar with `_category_.json` files
- Structured subcategories (e.g., `call-forwarding/`) for specific features
- Started with Cox Communications forwarding doc as first example
- Future channels: messaging, socials, fax, email to be added as needed

### Professional Provider Selection Interface (2024)
**Decision**: Create visual provider logo selection with working navigation
**Rationale**:
- Visual recognition faster than text-based provider lists
- Professional appearance builds trust with CBO administrators
- Scalable pattern for adding new providers
- Clear indication of available vs. coming soon providers

**Implementation**:
- Added provider logos to `/static/img/providers/` (Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum, Verizon)
- Created responsive flex layout with consistent logo sizing
- Used Docusaurus Link component for proper internal navigation
- Implemented visual feedback for available vs. unavailable providers
- Added comprehensive call forwarding overview page with Mermaid flow diagram

### Navigation and Linking Standards (2024)
**Decision**: Establish proper internal linking patterns for Docusaurus
**Critical Learning**: Regular `<a>` tags don't work for internal navigation in Docusaurus
**Solution**: Always use Docusaurus Link component for clickable elements

**Implementation**:
```jsx
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
<Link to="/full/path/to/page">Content</Link>
```
- Fixed all sidebar capitalization with `_category_.json` files
- Established consistent navigation patterns
- Created comprehensive README.md with developer guidelines

### Accessibility-First Approach
**Decision**: Make accessibility a top priority, not an afterthought
**Rationale**:
- ConnieRTC serves diverse communities with varying abilities
- Nonprofits often serve vulnerable populations
- Legal compliance (Section 508, ADA)
- Moral imperative for inclusive design

### Professional Services Template Feature Duplication Pattern (2024)
**Decision**: Establish standardized process for creating enhanced versions of existing template features
**Use Case**: When existing features need significant enhancements that could break existing implementations
**Solution**: Complete feature duplication with enhancements rather than modifying originals

**Rationale**:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing deployments
- Allows independent feature lifecycle management
- Enables A/B testing between original and enhanced versions
- Provides clear upgrade path for organizations

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. **Complete Architecture Duplication** (33+ files minimum)
   - Frontend: `/plugin-flex-ts-template-v2/src/feature-library/[feature-name-with-enhancement]/`
   - Backend: `/serverless-functions/src/functions/features/[feature-name-with-enhancement]/`
   - Infrastructure: `/infra-as-code/terraform/modules/[feature-name-with-enhancement]/`
   - Documentation: `/docs/docs/feature-library/[feature-name-with-enhancement].md`

2. **Independent Configuration System**
   - Separate feature flags in configuration
   - Independent environment variables
   - Distinct Terraform state management
   - Separate import/export functionality in `import_internal_state.sh`

3. **Template Standards Compliance**
   - Follow exact directory structure patterns
   - Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case)
   - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Add Terraform resource management

4. **Enhancement Integration Best Practices**
   - **Mission-Critical Mindset**: All components must work together or fail together
   - **Production-Grade Validation**: Implement comprehensive environment variable validation
   - **Twilio Support Standards**: Follow all recommended patterns for error handling, timeouts, and observability
   - **Non-Breaking Design**: Enhanced features should not interfere with original functionality

**Example Implementation**: `callback-and-voicemail-with-email`
- **Original**: `callback-and-voicemail` (basic functionality)
- **Enhanced**: `callback-and-voicemail-with-email` (adds Mailgun email notifications)
- **Result**: Two independent features that can be deployed separately

**Critical Success Factors**:
- **Complete Independence**: Enhanced feature must be 100% independent of original
- **Template Integration**: Must integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD and deployment processes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting documentation required
- **Testing**: Multi-test validation before considering complete
- **Environment Validation**: Robust validation prevents deployment-time failures

## UI Mockups & Prototyping

### **Admin Platform Mockups (July 2025)**
**Location**: `/docs/static/mockups/admin-ui-mockups/`
**Live URL**: https://docs.connie.one/mockups/admin-ui-mockups/

**Current Access**: Public (linked from password-protected connie.one dataroom)
**Future Todo**: Gate mockups folder for private stakeholder access (see todo list)

Professional HTML mockups using Twilio Paste design framework:
- `index.html` - Main Admin Dashboard (client overview, provider status, metrics)
- `onboarding.html` - New Client Onboarding Wizard (5-step process)
- `deployment.html` - Deployment Pipeline (prevents July 22nd incidents)
- `client-detail.html` - Client Management Detail View (HHOVV example)
- `billing.html` - Billing & Usage Analytics (revenue tracking)

**Stakeholder Access Strategy**: 
- Mockups are currently public but not easily discoverable
- Link provided in connie.one dataroom for investor access
- Future enhancement: Implement password protection or private hosting

**IMPORTANT for Future Agents**: When creating new mockups or prototypes:
1. Always add them to `/docs/static/mockups/[feature-name]/`
2. Use Twilio Paste CSS for consistency with existing ConnieRTC interface
3. Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
4. Test locally then commit to auto-deploy via GitHub Pages
5. Update this CLAUDE.md section with new mockup locations

### **Mockup Design Standards**
- **Framework**: Twilio Paste CSS (`https://paste.twilio.design/core/18.6.1/theme.css`)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with proper contrast ratios
- **Colors**: ConnieRTC brand colors (blue #0263E0, success #2DD15F, etc.)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with desktop enhancements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader friendly

## Current State (July 2025)

### Key Files & Patterns
- **Provider Logos**: `/static/img/providers/` (optimized for 180px width, 60px height max)
- **Category Structure**: Use `_category_.json` files for proper navigation labels
- **Internal Links**: Always use `import Link from '@docusaurus/Link'` for clickable elements
- **Content Organization**: `end-users/[type]/[channel]/[feature]/` hierarchy
- **Mockups**: `/static/mockups/[feature-name]/` for all prototypes and UI designs

### Ready for Expansion
- **Messaging Channel**: Directory structure ready, needs content
- **Socials Channel**: Directory structure ready, needs content  
- **Fax Channel**: Directory structure ready, needs content
- **Email Channel**: Directory structure ready, needs content
- **Additional Providers**: Logo + .md file pattern established
- **Future Mockups**: Admin platform foundation established for additional interfaces

### Development Workflow
1. Create content locally following patterns in README.md
2. Test locally with `npm start` at http://localhost:3010
3. Commit with descriptive messages (no AI attribution per user preference)
4. Push to `main` branch for automatic GitHub Pages deployment
5. Deployment typically completes in 2-3 minutes

## üö® CRITICAL: Callback-and-Voicemail-with-Email Production Deployment Protocol

**This is a PROVEN, SUCCESSFUL deployment workflow. Future AI agents MUST follow this EXACT sequence to avoid repeated failures.**

### Pre-Deployment Requirements Checklist

**NEVER start deployment without ALL of the following information:**

1. **Twilio Account Details**
   - Account SID (format: `AC...`)
   - Auth Token 
   - Twilio CLI profile configured and active

2. **Twilio Flex Configuration** 
   - Workspace SID (format: `WS...`)
   - Workflow SID for "Assign to Anyone" workflow (format: `WW...`)

3. **Phone Number & Mailgun Configuration**
   - Phone number to configure (format: `+1...`)
   - Admin email address(es) for notifications
   - Mailgun domain (format: `phonenumber.connie.center`)
   - Mailgun domain-specific sending API key (NOT private API key)

### Step-by-Step Deployment Protocol (NO EXCEPTIONS)

#### Step 1: Verify Account Access
```bash
twilio profiles:list
twilio profiles:use [ACCOUNT_NAME]
```
**‚úÖ Confirm**: Active profile shows correct Account SID

#### Step 2: Test Mailgun API Credentials FIRST
```bash
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" --user "api:[MAILGUN_API_KEY]" \
    https://api.mailgun.net/v3/[MAILGUN_DOMAIN]/messages \
    -F from='Test <test@[MAILGUN_DOMAIN]>' \
    -F to='[ADMIN_EMAIL]' \
    -F subject='[ACCOUNT] Production Mailgun API Test' \
    -F text='Testing Mailgun API credentials before deployment.'
```
**‚úÖ Required**: Must return HTTP 200 and Mailgun message ID
**‚ùå STOP**: If this fails, get correct API credentials before proceeding

#### Step 3: Update Environment Configuration
**File**: `/serverless-functions/.env`
```env
# Update ALL of these values for the target account
ACCOUNT_SID=[TARGET_ACCOUNT_SID]
AUTH_TOKEN=[TARGET_AUTH_TOKEN]
TWILIO_FLEX_WORKSPACE_SID=[TARGET_WORKSPACE_SID]
ADMIN_EMAIL=[TARGET_ADMIN_EMAIL]
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=[TARGET_MAILGUN_DOMAIN]
MAILGUN_API_KEY=[TARGET_MAILGUN_API_KEY]
```

#### Step 4: Update Hardcoded Workflow SID (CRITICAL)
**File**: `/serverless-functions/src/functions/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience.protected.js`
**Line**: ~135
```javascript
// TEMPORARY FIX: Hardcode workflow SID to bypass buggy queue friendlyName logic
const enqueuedWorkflowSid = '[TARGET_WORKFLOW_SID]'; // [ACCOUNT] Assign to Anyone workflow
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This step causes "option not available" errors if skipped

#### Step 5: Deploy Serverless Functions
```bash
npm run deploy
```
**‚úÖ Verify**: Note the deployment domain (e.g., `custom-flex-extensions-serverless-XXXX-dev.twil.io`)

#### Step 6: Create Studio Flow
**IMPORTANT**: Manual Console creation often fails. Use CLI approach:

**Create JSON file** (e.g., `[account]-callback-voicemail-email-flow.json`):
```json
{
  "description": "[ACCOUNT] Callback and Voicemail with Email Flow",
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "Trigger",
      "type": "trigger",
      "transitions": [
        {"event": "incomingMessage"},
        {"next": "send_to_flex_1", "event": "incomingCall"},
        {"event": "incomingConversationMessage"},
        {"event": "incomingRequest"},
        {"event": "incomingParent"}
      ],
      "properties": {
        "offset": {"x": -70, "y": -60}
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "send_to_flex_1",
      "type": "send-to-flex",
      "transitions": [
        {"event": "callComplete"},
        {"event": "failedToEnqueue"},
        {"event": "callFailure"}
      ],
      "properties": {
        "waitUrl": "https://[DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN]/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience",
        "offset": {"x": 170, "y": 100},
        "workflow": "[TARGET_WORKFLOW_SID]",
        "channel": "voice",
        "attributes": "{\"call_sid\": \"{{trigger.call.CallSid}}\", \"callBackData\": {\"attempts\": 0}}",
        "waitUrlMethod": "POST"
      }
    }
  ],
  "initial_state": "Trigger",
  "flags": {
    "allow_concurrent_calls": true
  }
}
```

**Deploy Studio Flow**:
```bash
twilio api:studio:v2:flows:create --friendly-name "[ACCOUNT] Callback and Voicemail with Email Flow" --status published --definition "$(cat [account]-callback-voicemail-email-flow.json)"
```

#### Step 7: Connect Phone Number
**In Twilio Console**: Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí [PHONE_NUMBER] ‚Üí Voice Configuration ‚Üí Studio Flow ‚Üí Select "[ACCOUNT] Callback and Voicemail with Email Flow"

#### Step 8: Test Complete Workflow
1. **Call** the phone number
2. **Press** `*` when prompted  
3. **Press** `2` for voicemail
4. **Record** a test message
5. **Verify**:
   - Voicemail task appears in Flex queue
   - Email notification sent to admin email with recording attached

### Function URLs for Monitoring
- **Email Function**: `https://[DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN]/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/send-voicemail-email`
- **Wait Experience Function**: `https://[DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN]/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience`

### Common Failure Points & Solutions

**‚ùå "Option not available at this time"**
- **Cause**: Forgot to update workflow SID in Step 4
- **Solution**: Update `wait-experience.protected.js` and redeploy

**‚ùå Email function 401/403 errors**
- **Cause**: Wrong Mailgun API key (using private instead of domain-specific sending key)
- **Solution**: Get correct domain-specific sending API key from Mailgun

**‚ùå Studio Flow not appearing in phone number configuration**
- **Cause**: Flow not published or creation failed
- **Solution**: Use CLI creation method (Step 6) instead of manual Console creation

**‚ùå Environment variables not visible in Console**
- **Cause**: Browser caching or wrong environment selected
- **Solution**: Verify deployment succeeded, check correct service/environment in Console

### Terminology Standards
- **‚úÖ CORRECT**: "Hold Music TwiML URL" (in Studio Flow Send to Flex widget)
- **‚ùå WRONG**: "Wait URL" (this doesn't exist and causes confusion)

### Success Metrics
- **First-call success**: All components work without debugging
- **Email delivery**: Admin receives voicemail with audio attachment
- **Task creation**: Voicemail appears in Flex queue for agent handling
- **Clean logs**: No authentication errors or failures in function logs

### Proven Results
- **DevSandBox**: ‚úÖ Working after authentication fixes
- **HHOVV**: ‚úÖ Working after workflow SID correction  
- **NSS Production**: ‚úÖ Working on FIRST deployment following this protocol

**Future AI agents**: Following this exact protocol resulted in first-try success on NSS production. Deviation from this sequence WILL result in repeated failures and user frustration.

## üéØ ConnieRTC Strategic Architecture & Planning (July 2025)
